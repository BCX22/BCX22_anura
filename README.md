## Team *anura*
## BCX Hackathon 2022 

**Vision**:
*We want to create the geriatric care room of the future. Sensors, A.I. & Connectivity will enable a multi-layered network that allows caregivers, autonomous systems and relatives to work hand in hand in care for the well-being of the elderly.*



### Need 
The number of people in care in germany will rise by millions over the next 30-40 years. At the same time there is already a extreme shortage of caregivers. The consequences are non targeted care, isolation, stressed caregivers. Ovrall a critical situation in many retirement homes.


### Creation
We desinged a care space enhanced with technology to enable the caregivers for more targeted work and to bring relatives/friends closer to the daily live of the elderly.

### Architecture
In our prototyp we created a camera connected to an NVIDIA Jetson as Edge AIoT device. We deployed a model for motion detection and connected via the Azure IoT Hub and Kafka to MongoDB.

We thought of the two main groups involved in caregiving and how to enable them.

**1. Caregivers**

Can be supported by:
- autonomus systems, e.g. via mood adoptions light light within the room.
- Dashboard roviding data insights in th current status und development
- early warnings in critical situtations


**2. Family & Friends**

Can be supported by:
- info about current status
- contact possibilitis: messages, planning visits
- dirct interaction with the personell
